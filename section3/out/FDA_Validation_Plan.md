# HippoVolume.AI FDA Validation Plan

## Device Name
HippoVolume.AI

## Intended Use
HippoVolume.AI is used to assist doctors to measure the Hippocampal Volume of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

## Training data
The training data was the "Hippocampus" dataset, which was obtained from the [Medical Decathlon competition](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). The original images are T2 MRI scans of the full brain. A rectangular portion of the hippocampus region was cut out by a tool named HippoCrop by the radiologist and used as training data.

## Ground Truth Acquisition Methodology
Training data was labeled and annotated by experienced radiologists.

## Algorithm Performance
The algorithm performance of HippoVolume.AI was measured by the Dicer score and the Jacarrd score.
According to the training results, the mean Dicer score is 0.896, and the mean Jacarrd score 0.814.
The Real-world performance is estimated by comparing the results generated by  HippoVolume.AI and the ground truth.
Since the algorithm is trained on the cropped hippocampus region of MRI images obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients. It may not perform well on non-Alzheimer's disease patients. It may not perform well on the full brain image that did not crop beforehand.
